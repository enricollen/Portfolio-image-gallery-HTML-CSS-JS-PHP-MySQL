# Portfolio-image-site-HTML-CSS-JS-PHP-MySQL
A portfolio site mockup written in html, css, js, php and MySQL.<br> I also developed an image folder manager, and a image caption manager, which makes a lot easier to manage, edit, delete and upload your photos. <br>I set user/psw for admin panel as 'admin/admin' by default, you can change it editing values in "admin" MySQL table.<br> For DB connecting parameters go edit the following files:<br> 1. database_connection.php <br>2. files/gestore_cartelle.php <br>3. files/action.php <br>4. files/upload.php.
